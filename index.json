One such problem in this field is Vision and Language Navigation. In this project, we developed a framework in which an agent navigates through a path from a given starting point by following the natural language instructions provided in an indoor house setting. Each subsequent point location in the path was perceived by the agent as a 360Â° image of what a human eye sees by standing on that location.\nIn order to solve this problem, we leveraged both the natural language instructions and the images at each location to output navigation directions at each location and hence finally reaching the intended destination. The framework makes use of dynamic memory networks and reinforcement learning.\nTechnical tools: Pytorch\n","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"9b74b6d80c74c11210b876d3c28bd186","permalink":"https://Likhitha96.github.io/project/project1/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project1/","section":"project","summary":" ","tags":["Computer vision","Natural Language Processing","Deep Learning"],"title":"Vision and Language Navigation","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Style transfer is a technique of applying the style of another image on a base image called as the content image in our project.

By iterative moving in the direction of the steepest descent, we arrive at a minimum of the cost function. Gradient descent is used in a lot of machine learning techniques to update model parameters, be it the coefficient in linear regression or the weights in neural networks. While stochastic gradient descent calculates gradient for seeing each data point and updates the parameters each time, parallelizing SGD is an approach to leverage the effectiveness of stochastic gradient descent but also reduction in time.\nIt also satisfies the requirement of huge computational power in a distributed fashion and reduce load on a single machine.\nThe motivation behind this project is to explore the current distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithms and compare their performance between different datasets.\nIt intends to examine the sensitivity of different datasets to different algorithms.\nTechincal tools: Python, Apache Spark\n","date":1506816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506816000,"objectID":"5302252e8f3539312931c7276cda35e3","permalink":"https://Likhitha96.github.io/project/project2/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project2/","section":"project","summary":" ","tags":["Distributed Computing","Machine Learning"],"title":"Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent","type":"project"}]
